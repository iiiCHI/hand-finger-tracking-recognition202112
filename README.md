# hand-finger-tracking-recognition202112
gesture recognition and finger tracking using Leapmotion for 5 typical gestures.

This project aims to gesture recognition and hand/finger tracking based only on the trajectories of gesture using Leapmotion sensors.

Since the Leapmotion could give moderate trajectories information, but is unable to give the attitude information, so this project try to achieve the spatial trajectory-based hand/finger tracking and gesture semantic recognition.

Five typical gestures consided here, they are
- pointing
- pan/move
- rotation
- scale
- grip

## What we try to get
- a prototype system including the software.
- a video demo
- patents
- papers, ISS, MobileCHI, IPIN

## contributors:
- Feng Jingtian, 2021--?
